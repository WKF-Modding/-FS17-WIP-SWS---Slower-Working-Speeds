# -FS17-WIP-SWS---Slower-Working-Speeds

What is SWS?

SWS is a very basic script that aims at lowering the work speed limits. Nothing fancy.
- It comes with modelleichers FillTypeMassAdjustment to give it an extra layer of "realism". 
- All SWS edits are listed in their own category in the shop and they are not listed by price atm. (Will come when i get time to do it)
- Theres a camera script that lets you change fov on foot and in vehicles.


Why?

Because i miss the relaxed gameplay that i had with MR in FS13 and mrLight in FS15. I miss the times where i have been harvesting with a max speed of 6 kmh instead of the usual Giant speeds. This brings that back!


Will it be like MR or mrLight?

Put simple, no! 
I have no knowledge in coding, so i have no intentions to call this a follow up for any of them. I simply modified some numbers from the base file to make them go slower.
I am hoping to figure out how to get the same feature as both mrLight and MR had with the altered pricing and usage of seeds and fertilizer including the ability to "erase" the seeds and get money back when swapping seeds. But again, its most likely not gonna happen as i can not code.


Status:

The mod is still very WIP. 
I have kindly got permission from bassaddict to use mrLight as a reference point in regards to the implement data. This means that all implements that was in FS15 and are in FS17 have the same values. I have tried getting all the new stuff as close as i could.
So far its all header types, mowers, tedders, windrowers, cultivators, seeders, ploughs, sprayers, slurry and manure trailers, forage wagons and balers are done. 
The exhaust smoke is a bit darker on all vehicles and i lowered the fill speed of implement like seeders and so on.
The Holmer Felix can now load bulk materials and not only beets.
